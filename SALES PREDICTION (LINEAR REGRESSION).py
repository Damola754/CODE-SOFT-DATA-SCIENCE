# Interpretation and Summary Report for Sales Prediction
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Summary of the Analysis
# 
# Data Preprocessing and Splitting:
# The dataset is split into training and test sets.
# Features (TV advertising spending) and target (Sales) are defined.
# 
# Model Training:
# A linear regression model is trained using the training data.
# The model aims to predict sales based on TV advertising spending.
# 
# Model Evaluation:
# The performance of the model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics.
# The model's predictions are compared with actual sales data for both the training and test sets.
# Interpretation of Results
# 
# Training Data Evaluation:
# 
# Mean Squared Error (MSE): 4.998
# This indicates the average squared difference between the actual sales and the predicted sales. A lower value indicates better fit.
# R-squared (R²): 0.813
# This indicates that approximately 81.3% of the variance in sales can be explained by the TV advertising spending in the training data.
# 
# Test Data Evaluation:
# 
# Mean Squared Error (MSE): 6.10
# This is slightly higher than the MSE for the training data, indicating a slightly worse fit on the test data.
# R-squared (R²): 0.803
# This indicates that approximately 80.3% of the variance in sales can be explained by the TV advertising spending in the test data, which is very close to the training data performance.
# 
# Visualizations
# 
# Training Data Visualization:
# A scatter plot of actual vs. predicted sales for the training data is shown.
# The red line represents the linear regression fit.
# The close clustering of points around the red line indicates a good fit
# 
# Visualizations
# 
# Test Data Visualization:
# A scatter plot of actual vs. predicted sales for the training data is shown.
# The red line represents the linear regression fit.
# The close clustering of points around the red line indicates a good fit. 
# 
# 
# Interpretation
# 
# The analysis involves a linear regression model to predict sales based on TV advertising spending. The model shows good performance with an R-squared (R²) value of 0.813 for training data and 0.803 for test data, indicating that around 80% of the variance in sales is explained by TV spending. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is 4.998 for training and 6.10 for test data, showing slightly worse performance on test data but still a reasonable fit. Visualizations confirm a good alignment between actual and predicted sales. Overall, TV advertising is a strong predictor of sales, and the model generalizes well to new data.
